# Differentiable_FEM

Following a finite-element scheme, we propose an optimization strategy that adapts the location and sizes of the elements in the mesh. We implemented FEM-r adaptivity in a 1D scheme using both dense and sparse formats, and in a 2D scheme using only the dense format.

Additionally, we developed a neural network that learns the relationship between the $\sigma$ function in the PDEs and the optimal grid to achieve the minimal Ritz value.
